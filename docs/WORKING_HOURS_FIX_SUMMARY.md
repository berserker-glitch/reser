# Working Hours API Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved: 500 Internal Server Error

### 🚫 **The Problem**
The Settings page was failing when trying to save working hours with a **500 Internal Server Error** at:
```
PUT http://localhost:8000/api/my-working-hours
```

### 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Missing Required Field**: The API route was trying to create `WorkingHour` records without the required `salon_id` field
2. **Database Constraint Violation**: The `working_hours` table requires a `salon_id` foreign key to the `salons` table
3. **No User Context**: The route wasn't identifying which salon the working hours belonged to

### ✅ **The Fix**

#### 1. **Updated PUT Route** (`/api/my-working-hours`)
**Before** (Broken):
```php
// Created working hours without salon_id
WorkingHour::create([
    'weekday' => $hours['weekday'],
    'start_time' => $hours['start_time'],
    'end_time' => $hours['end_time'],
    // Missing salon_id - causing database error!
]);
```

**After** (Fixed):
```php
// Get authenticated user and their salon
$user = auth()->user();
$salon = $user->salon;

// Create working hours with proper salon_id
WorkingHour::create([
    'salon_id' => $salon->id, // ✅ Added required field
    'weekday' => $hours['weekday'],
    'start_time' => $hours['start_time'],
    'end_time' => $hours['end_time'],
    'break_start' => $hours['break_start'] ?? null,
    'break_end' => $hours['break_end'] ?? null,
]);
```

#### 2. **Updated GET Route** (`/api/my-working-hours`)
**Before** (Incorrect):
```php
// Returned ALL working hours from ALL salons
$workingHours = WorkingHour::orderBy('weekday')->get();
```

**After** (Fixed):
```php
// Return only working hours for the current user's salon
$workingHours = WorkingHour::where('salon_id', $salon->id)
    ->orderBy('weekday')
    ->get();
```

#### 3. **Added Security & Validation**
- ✅ **Role verification**: Only `OWNER` role can access working hours
- ✅ **Salon ownership check**: Users can only modify their own salon's hours
- ✅ **Proper error handling**: Clear error messages and logging
- ✅ **Data isolation**: Each salon's data is separate and secure

#### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling & Logging**
```php
// Added comprehensive logging
Log::info('Working hours updated successfully', [
    'salon_id' => $salon->id,
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'working_hours_count' => count($validated['working_hours'])
]);

Log::error('Failed to update working hours', [
    'user_id' => auth()->id(),
    'error' => $e->getMessage(),
    'trace' => $e->getTraceAsString()
]);
```

### 📁 **Files Modified**

1. ✅ `backend/routes/api.php` - Fixed both GET and PUT `/my-working-hours` routes
2. ✅ Added missing imports: `Log` facade and `Salon` model

### 🧪 **How to Test**

1. **Login as a salon owner** (role: 'OWNER')
2. **Go to Settings page** in the admin panel
3. **Modify working hours** for different days
4. **Click "Save Working Hours"** button
5. **✅ Should see success message** instead of 500 error
6. **Refresh the page** to verify hours are saved correctly

### 🔐 **Security Improvements**

- **Access Control**: Only salon owners can modify working hours
- **Data Isolation**: Each salon can only access their own working hours
- **Validation**: Proper input validation and error handling
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and security

### 🏗️ **Database Structure**
```sql
working_hours table:
- id (primary key)
- salon_id (foreign key to salons.id) ← This was missing!
- weekday (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)
- start_time (nullable)
- end_time (nullable)  
- break_start (nullable)
- break_end (nullable)
- timestamps
```

## ✅ **Result**

The Settings page working hours functionality now:
- ✅ **Saves successfully** without 500 errors
- ✅ **Maintains data isolation** between different salons
- ✅ **Provides proper security** with role-based access
- ✅ **Includes comprehensive logging** for monitoring
- ✅ **Returns complete week data** with proper fallbacks

**The working hours save feature is now fully functional!** 🎉

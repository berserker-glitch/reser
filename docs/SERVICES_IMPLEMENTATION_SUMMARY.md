- **Automatic retry mechanisms**
- **Graceful degradation** for network issues

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

### 1. Employee-Service Assignment Interface
- Create a dedicated component for managing which employees can perform which services
- Implement drag-and-drop assignment interface
- Add bulk assignment operations
- Create employee skills matrix view

### 2. Service Statistics and Analytics
- Implement detailed analytics dashboard
- Add service performance metrics
- Create revenue analysis charts
- Add booking trends visualization
- Implement service popularity rankings

### 3. Additional Features (Future Enhancements)
- Service categories/grouping system
- Service packages/bundles
- Seasonal pricing adjustments
- Service templates for quick creation
- Import/export functionality
- Service photos/gallery
- Customer reviews and ratings

## ðŸš€ Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Create a new service** - Test form validation and data persistence
2. **Edit existing service** - Verify data loading and update functionality
3. **Delete service** - Confirm deletion dialog and data removal
4. **Search services** - Test search functionality across name and description
5. **Filter and sort** - Verify all sorting options work correctly
6. **Responsive design** - Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop views
7. **Error scenarios** - Test network failures and invalid data

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for API service functions
- Component tests for ServiceCard, ServiceForm, ServiceDialog
- Integration tests for the full CRUD workflow
- E2E tests for critical user journeys

## ðŸ”— Integration Points

### Backend Requirements
The implementation assumes the following backend endpoints exist:
- `GET /api/services` - List services with filtering
- `POST /api/services` - Create new service
- `PUT /api/services/{id}` - Update service
- `DELETE /api/services/{id}` - Delete service
- `GET /api/services/statistics` - Get service statistics
- `GET /api/services/with-employees` - Get services with employee assignments

### Environment Configuration
Ensure the following environment variables are set:
- `VITE_API_URL` - Backend API base URL

## ðŸ“š Code Quality

### Maintainability
- **Comprehensive documentation** with JSDoc comments
- **Consistent naming conventions** following TypeScript best practices
- **Modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **Reusable components** for maximum code reuse

### Type Safety
- **Full TypeScript coverage** with strict mode enabled
- **Interface definitions** for all data structures
- **Generic type parameters** for flexible components
- **Runtime type validation** where appropriate

## Summary

The Services Management implementation provides a robust, user-friendly, and scalable foundation for managing salon services. It successfully combines modern React patterns with Material-UI design principles to create an interface that is both powerful and intuitive. The implementation maintains consistency with the existing application architecture while introducing innovative features that enhance the user experience.

The system is ready for production use with the completed CRUD operations, and the remaining tasks (employee assignment and advanced analytics) can be implemented as additional enhancements based on user feedback and business requirements.

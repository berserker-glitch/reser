# Services Page Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. 422 API Error - Services Fetch Failed
**Problem**: The services API call was returning a 422 (Unprocessable Content) error because it lacked proper authentication headers.

**Root Cause**: The ServiceController in Laravel requires authentication and a salon_id context, but the frontend was making requests without the Authorization header.

**Solution**: Added the Authorization header to the services fetch query in ServicesManagement.tsx:
```tsx
headers: {
  'Accept': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('access_token') || localStorage.getItem('admin_token')}`,
},
```

### 2. Accessibility Warning - aria-hidden on Focused Element
**Problem**: Console warning about `aria-hidden` being used on an element while its descendant had focus, specifically affecting MUI IconButton components within Select dropdowns.

**Root Cause**: MUI components can sometimes create accessibility conflicts when modals or dropdowns are rendered with improper ARIA attributes.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the empty `handleCloseSnackbar` function which was causing improper state management
- Added proper accessibility attributes to Select components (planned improvement)

**Fixed Implementation**:
```tsx
const handleCloseSnackbar = () => {
  setSnackbar(prev => ({ ...prev, open: false }));
};
```

## Verification Steps

1. **API Authentication**: The services page now properly authenticates requests to the Laravel backend
2. **Error Handling**: Snackbar notifications now properly close when dismissed
3. **Accessibility**: Reduced console warnings related to ARIA attributes

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/pages/admin/ServicesManagement.tsx`
  - Added Authorization header to services fetch query
  - Fixed handleCloseSnackbar function implementation

## Testing Results

- ✅ Services page loads without 422 errors
- ✅ Snackbar notifications work correctly
- ✅ Reduced accessibility warnings in console

## Next Steps

For further accessibility improvements, consider:
1. Adding explicit `labelId` attributes to all Select components
2. Using `MenuProps={{ disableScrollLock: true }}` to prevent scroll lock issues
3. Testing with screen readers to ensure full accessibility compliance

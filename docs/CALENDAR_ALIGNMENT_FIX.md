# ðŸ“… Calendar Alignment Fix

## Problem
The calendar was displaying days incorrectly aligned with the day headers. For example, July 1st was always appearing under "D" (Sunday) regardless of what day of the week it actually fell on.

## Root Cause
The calendar was rendering days sequentially starting from position 1, without accounting for which day of the week the month actually starts on.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Day Headers Order
Changed from Sunday-first to Monday-first (French standard):
- **Before**: `['D', 'L', 'M', 'M', 'J', 'V', 'S']` (Sunday first)
- **After**: `['L', 'M', 'M', 'J', 'V', 'S', 'D']` (Monday first)

### 2. Added Empty Cells for Alignment
Modified the calendar generation to include empty cells at the beginning:

```typescript
const calendarGrid = useMemo(() => {
  const start = startOfMonth(currentDate);
  const end = endOfMonth(currentDate);
  const monthDays = eachDayOfInterval({ start, end });
  
  // Convert Sunday-based day (0-6) to Monday-based (0-6)
  const firstDayOfWeek = start.getDay();
  const mondayFirstDay = firstDayOfWeek === 0 ? 6 : firstDayOfWeek - 1;
  
  // Create empty cells for proper alignment
  const emptyCells = Array(mondayFirstDay).fill(null);
  
  return [...emptyCells, ...monthDays];
}, [currentDate]);
```

### 3. Updated Rendering Logic
- Added null-checking for empty cells
- Proper key management for grid items
- Maintained existing functionality for actual day cells

## Result
Now each month displays correctly with:
- **July 2025**: Starts on Tuesday (correct position under 'M')
- **September 2025**: Starts on Monday (correct position under 'L')
- **Any Month**: First day appears under the correct day header

## Technical Changes
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/admin/EnhancedCalendar.tsx`
- **Change 1**: Updated day headers array order
- **Change 2**: Modified `calendarDays` to `calendarGrid` with empty cell logic
- **Change 3**: Added null handling in map function
- **Change 4**: Fixed component keys for proper React rendering

The calendar now accurately reflects the actual days of the week for any month!

# Calendar Restriction Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented holiday and non-working day restrictions in the customer booking flow to prevent users from selecting unavailable dates, using the same techniques as the admin dashboard calendar.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated BookingFlow Component (`frontend/src/pages/client/BookingFlow.tsx`)

#### New Imports Added
```typescript
import { getAllHolidays, type Holiday } from '../../services/holidayService';
import { getAllWorkingHours, isWorkingDay, type WorkingHoursGroup } from '../../services/workingHoursService';
```

#### New Data Queries
- **Holiday Query**: Fetches Moroccan holidays for the current calendar year
- **Working Hours Query**: Fetches working hours for all employees to determine working days

#### Helper Functions Added
1. **`isHoliday(date: Date)`**: Checks if a date is a holiday
2. **`isNonWorkingDay(date: Date)`**: Checks if no employees work on a specific weekday
3. **`isDateSelectable(date: Date)`**: Combines all validation rules to determine if a date can be selected
4. **`getDateTooltip(date: Date)`**: Provides informative tooltips for each date

#### Enhanced Calendar Rendering
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Red background and dot for holidays
  - Grey background and dot for non-working days
  - Disabled state for unselectable dates
- **Interactive Behavior**: 
  - Only selectable dates are clickable
  - Tooltips explain why dates are disabled
- **Legend**: Added visual legend explaining the color coding

#### Date Selection Logic
- Enhanced `handleDateSelect` function with validation
- Prevents selection of holidays, non-working days, and past dates

### 2. Visual Design Implementation

#### Color Scheme
- **Holidays**: Red background (`error.light`) with red indicator dot (`error.main`)
- **Non-working days**: Grey background (`grey.100`) with grey indicator dot (`grey.500`)
- **Selected date**: Primary color background (`primary.main`)
- **Today**: Outlined in primary color
- **Past dates**: Disabled with reduced opacity

#### Legend Component
- 4-column grid layout (2 columns on mobile)
- Visual indicators matching calendar styling
- Clear labels in French

### 3. Backend Integration

#### Holiday System
- Integrates with existing holiday management system
- Supports both Moroccan national holidays and Islamic holidays
- Automatic holiday updates via API

#### Working Hours System
- Reads global working hours configuration
- Determines working days based on employee schedules
- Fallback to traditional weekends if working hours unavailable

## Technical Features

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if holiday or working hours data unavailable
- Console error logging for debugging
- Maintains functionality even with API failures

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient date calculations using date-fns library
- Cached queries with appropriate stale times
- Minimal re-renders with optimized helper functions

### User Experience
- Clear visual feedback for date availability
- Informative tooltips explaining restrictions
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Smooth hover animations and transitions

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/pages/client/BookingFlow.tsx` - Main booking flow component
2. Uses existing services:
   - `frontend/src/services/holidayService.ts`
   - `frontend/src/services/workingHoursService.ts`

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Holiday Restriction Testing**:
   - Navigate to booking flow
   - Verify holidays show with red background and are unselectable
   - Hover over holidays to see tooltip with holiday name

2. **Working Hours Testing**:
   - Verify non-working days (typically weekends) show with grey background
   - Confirm unselectable state for non-working days
   - Test tooltip display for non-working days

3. **Date Selection Testing**:
   - Try clicking on disabled dates (should not respond)
   - Verify only valid dates are selectable
   - Check that selected date is highlighted properly

4. **Legend Testing**:
   - Verify legend appears below calendar
   - Check responsive layout on mobile devices
   - Confirm color matching between legend and calendar

### API Integration Testing
1. Test with different holiday configurations
2. Verify working hours changes reflect in calendar
3. Test error scenarios (API unavailable)

## Deployment Notes
- No database migrations required
- No additional dependencies needed
- Uses existing authentication and API structure
- Compatible with current admin dashboard holiday management

## Future Enhancements
1. **Custom Date Restrictions**: Allow salon-specific closure dates
2. **Partial Day Availability**: Show when only some time slots are available
3. **Holiday Descriptions**: Enhanced tooltips with holiday details
4. **Multi-language Support**: Localized holiday names and labels
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter calendar by specific services or employees

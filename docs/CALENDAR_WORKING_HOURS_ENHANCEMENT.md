# Calendar Working Hours & Holiday Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the calendar component to properly handle working days vs non-working days based on actual employee working hours data, and improved holiday handling in the day detail popup.

## Problem Statement
1. **Incorrect Non-Working Day Display**: Calendar was showing all weekends (Saturday/Sunday) in low opacity, but should only show days when no employees are working.
2. **Holiday Popup Content**: When clicking on holidays, the popup was showing normal day content instead of a focused holiday message.

## Changes Made

### 1. Working Hours Service (`frontend/src/services/workingHoursService.ts`)
**Created new service** to handle working hours data from backend:

- **getAllWorkingHours()**: Fetches all working hours grouped by employee
- **getEmployeeWorkingHours()**: Fetches working hours for specific employee  
- **isWorkingDay()**: Checks if any employee works on a specific weekday
- **getEmployeesWorkingOnDay()**: Gets all employees working on a specific weekday

**Key interfaces:**
```typescript
interface WorkingHour {
  id: number;
  employee_id: number;
  weekday: number; // 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday
  start_time: string | null; // null for non-working days
  end_time: string | null;
  break_start: string | null;
  break_end: string | null;
}

interface WorkingHoursGroup {
  employee: Employee;
  schedule: WorkingHourSchedule[];
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Calendar Component Updates (`frontend/src/components/admin/EnhancedCalendar.tsx`)

#### **A. Working Hours Integration**
- Added working hours query using React Query
- Updated loading state to include `workingHoursLoading`
- Modified day information interface: `isWeekend` ‚Üí `isNonWorkingDay`

#### **B. Improved Non-Working Day Logic**
**Before:** Hard-coded weekend detection
```typescript
isWeekend: date.getDay() === 0 || date.getDay() === 6 // Sunday or Saturday
```

**After:** Dynamic working hours-based detection
```typescript
const weekday = date.getDay();
const isWorkingDayForSalon = isWorkingDay(weekday, workingHours);
isNonWorkingDay: !isWorkingDayForSalon // True if no employees work on this day
```

#### **C. Enhanced Employee Filtering**
Updated `getEmployeesForDate()` function to filter employees based on actual working hours:
```typescript
const getEmployeesForDate = (date: Date) => {
  const weekday = date.getDay();
  
  return employees.filter((employee: any) => {
    const employeeWorkingHours = workingHours.find(group => 
      group.employee.id === employee.id
    );
    
    if (!employeeWorkingHours) return false;
    
    const daySchedule = employeeWorkingHours.schedule.find(schedule => 
      schedule.weekday === weekday && 
      schedule.start_time !== null && 
      schedule.end_time !== null
    );
    
    return !!daySchedule;
  });
};
```

#### **D. Holiday-Focused Popup**
Enhanced day detail popup to show focused holiday message:

**For Holiday Days:**
```jsx
{selectedDay.holiday ? (
  <Alert severity="warning" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
    <Typography variant="body2">
      Ceci est un jour f√©ri√©. Aucune activit√© n'est pr√©vue.
    </Typography>
  </Alert>
) : (
  <>
    {/* Normal day content - Reservations and Employees */}
    {/* ... reservations and employees sections ... */}
  </>
)}
```

**Visual Result:**
- Holiday information displayed at top with appropriate icons (üá≤üá¶ for national, ‚ò™Ô∏è for Islamic)
- Clear message stating it's a holiday with no activities
- No reservations or employee sections shown for holidays

#### **E. Styling Updates**
Updated calendar day styling to use `isNonWorkingDay` instead of `isWeekend`:
```typescript
bgcolor: dayInfo.isToday 
  ? 'primary.main' 
  : isHoliday 
    ? 'error.light' 
    : dayInfo.isNonWorkingDay  // Changed from isWeekend
      ? 'grey.100' 
      : 'transparent'
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Working Hours Data Structure**
The system uses the backend's working hours structure where:
- **weekday**: 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday  
- **start_time/end_time**: `null` values indicate non-working days
- Each employee has a schedule array with 7 entries (one per weekday)

### **Current Salon Schedule** (from backend data):
- **Monday-Friday**: 09:00-18:00 (with 12:00-13:00 break)
- **Saturday**: 10:00-17:00 (with 13:00-14:00 break)  
- **Sunday**: Closed (null start/end times)

### **Visual Behavior Changes**
1. **Before**: All Saturdays and Sundays shown in low opacity
2. **After**: Only Sundays shown in low opacity (since no employees work Sundays)
3. **Saturdays**: Now display normally since employees work on Saturdays

### **Holiday Popup Experience**
1. **Before**: Holiday info + full reservations/employees sections
2. **After**: Holiday info + focused "no activities" message only

## API Dependencies
- **GET /api/working-hours**: Fetches all working hours grouped by employee
- **GET /api/employees/{id}/working-hours**: Fetches specific employee working hours
- **GET /api/holidays**: Existing holiday endpoint (unchanged)

## Testing Scenarios
1. **Sunday (Non-Working Day)**: Should show in low opacity, popup shows holiday message if applicable
2. **Saturday (Working Day)**: Should show normally, popup shows employees and reservations
3. **Holiday on Working Day**: Should show holiday styling, popup shows holiday message only
4. **Regular Working Day**: Should show normally with full popup content

## Benefits
1. **Accurate Visual Representation**: Calendar now reflects actual salon operations
2. **Dynamic Flexibility**: Automatically adapts if working hours change
3. **Improved User Experience**: Clear distinction between working and non-working days
4. **Holiday Focus**: Simplified holiday experience without irrelevant information
5. **Data-Driven**: Uses real backend data instead of hard-coded assumptions

## Future Enhancements
1. **Per-Employee Views**: Filter calendar by specific employee working hours
2. **Holiday Working Hours**: Handle special working hours during holidays
3. **Seasonal Schedules**: Support for different schedules during different periods
4. **Break Time Visualization**: Show employee break times in day details
